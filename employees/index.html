    <h3>The Illustrious Leader 516</h3>
    <p class="pemp">The most cleverest of the JMC crew and its illustrious leader; the self proclaimed "kind of a big deal." 516 was the first to take the JMC throne post apocalypse. With the power of capitalism at his side and advanced science and technologies at his beck and call, 516 has the most clever plans to take over the wastes and claim it as his own in the name of profit. "Scissors. Everytime."

    <h3>Umlaut 148</h3>
    <p class="pemp">Vinegar (pronounced "Vine Gar") Strokes was meant to serve as a corporate translator and communications specialist. Repeated clonings have made his basic speech... less than understandable. Switching between multiple accents and mispronouncing most words have become the norm. Most clones call him "Umlaut" for his penchant to use seemingly unneeded accent marks on damn near everything.
